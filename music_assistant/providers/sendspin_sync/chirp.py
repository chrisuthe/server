"""
Calibration chirp signal for the Sendspin Sync plugin.

Builds the repeating calibration track: a short logarithmic sine sweep at the
start of every fixed-length period, followed by a near-silent noise bed.

Two properties of this signal are load-bearing for the latency measurement that
consumes it. The period is a metronome running on the server clock, so its
length is fixed in whole frames and the emitted audio is one precomputed period
repeated verbatim - anything that recomputes the waveform per chunk risks
drifting the spacing. And the pulse is a swept sine rather than a noise burst
because matched-filter correlation against a sweep compresses room reverberation
into a sharp peak, which onset detection on noise does not.
