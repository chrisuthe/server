"""
Calibration session orchestration for the Sendspin Sync plugin.

A session commandeers a set of Sendspin players, groups them onto a hidden
Sendspin virtual player and starts the calibration track on that anchor's queue
exactly once. The phone-side probe then measures one speaker at a time, driven
by :meth:`CalibrationSession.solo`.

Two properties of the orchestration are load-bearing for the measurement:

- **The stream is started once and never restarted.** The chirp train is a
  metronome running on the server clock and the probe recovers a speaker's
  latency as a phase offset against it, so a restart resets the timeline and
  invalidates every measurement taken against the old one. Isolation therefore
  only ever touches per-player mute/volume, never the queue.
- **Only one member is audible at a time**, so an arrival can be attributed to a
  specific speaker.

The anchor is a virtual player rather than one of the targets on purpose. It
owns its own queue, so no user queue is ever replaced, and it never renders
audio itself, so every target is a uniform group member reached through the same
sync path - a real leader would render through the leader path instead and its
latency would not be comparable to the members'.

    Normalise a session's measured arrival offsets into absolute static delays.

    A probe reports one offset per speaker, measured against a baseline it picked for
    itself, so only the differences between them carry meaning. A Sendspin static
    delay *advances* a player - the client subtracts it from the server timestamp, so
    a larger value makes the sound leave that speaker earlier - and the protocol
    carries no negative value. Equalising a group is therefore a matter of leaving the
    earliest speaker where it is and pulling every later one forward to meet it, so the
    whole group converges on the earliest arrival and that speaker is given zero.

    The delay each player already carries is part of the sum, which makes this
    converge rather than drift: re-measuring an already corrected group yields the
    same delays again instead of stacking a second correction on the first, and a
    delay the user set by hand for an amp is respected instead of being flattened.

    Refuses rather than clamps. A measurement implying a delay past the end of the
    supported range is not a speaker latency, and the largest plausible-looking value
    would bury the bad measurement instead of reporting it.
