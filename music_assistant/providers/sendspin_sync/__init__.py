"""
Sendspin Sync plugin provider.

Declares a dependency on the Sendspin player provider, so it only loads once
Sendspin is up. It exposes a single AudioSource - the calibration chirp track -
which plays through the regular playback path so the latency measured from it
matches the latency of real music on the same player.

On top of that source it orchestrates calibration sessions: a set of Sendspin
speakers is grouped onto a hidden anchor, the chirp train runs once for the whole
session, and the API commands registered here walk the speakers one at a time
while a phone-side probe measures each arrival. See session.py for the session
itself.

        Turn the session's measured arrival offsets into static delays and apply them.

        The offsets are *relative*: the probe measures every speaker against one
        arbitrary shared baseline, so only the differences between them mean anything.
        Each player's current static delay is folded in before normalising, which keeps
        re-running a calibration convergent instead of drifting.

        Starting a session takes off every static delay MA can write, so a measured
        speaker comes in at 0 and its correction falls out of the measurement alone.
        That correction therefore replaces whatever delay MA held for that speaker,
        including one the user set by hand - the session put it back only if the speaker
        was left unmeasured. What a speaker's own firmware applies is neither readable
        nor removable and is already inside the arrival that was measured.

        Every speaker in the session is normalised the same way, including one whose
        client does not accept a static delay - it belongs in the baseline the others
        are measured against just as much, and may well be the earliest arrival that
        defines it. Only the last step splits: the delays MA can write are written and
        come back under ``applied``, and the rest come back under ``manual`` for the
        user to set on the device itself. An ``applied`` value replaces the delay its
        speaker carried; a ``manual`` value is added to whatever its firmware already
        applies. See :class:`CalibrationResult`.

        Every member of the session must be measured, and nothing is written until every
        value has been computed and accepted, so no rejected measurement can leave the
        group half corrected. A player that drops off mid-apply still can: the write that
        fails raises and the players already written keep their new delay. The returned
        result is therefore only meaningful on success.

        Leaves the session running so the result can be verified in place: measure
        again, and every speaker should now report the same arrival. The session's
